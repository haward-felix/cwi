                    <p>
                        In 2013, a tourist, Justin Southerland visited Bussi Island, in Wakiso district, Uganda East Africa, in search of Hippopotamuses and crocodiles. 
                        He did not find any but he discovered impoverished fishing communities, in dire need of help. Moved by the high vulnerability levels of the 
                        island communities, he jumped right in to help. He noticed island locals fetching unsafe water straight out of the lake for home use including 
                        cooking and drinking; the same lake water where they washed their clothes, bathed, stepped while fishing et al. Together with a group of locals, 
                        the immediate need he identified was provision of clean water for domestic use.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="history-item">
                    <img src="images/water.jpg" alt="History Image 2" class="history-image right">
                    <p>
                        Since then, Justin has mobilized many other like-minded donors who have generously given to the cause of the island communities. Over one 
                        hundred boreholes have been constructed and repaired on the different islands that constitute Bussi Subcounty. Hence, Amazzi Wellness Initiatives 
                        was born. It has been a wonderful 10-year journey of bringing hope and restoring dignity to Lake Victoria Island communities through implementation 
                        of various projects, including digging wells to avail safe water for domestic use to the locals, supporting community vulnerable children with an 
                        assortment of items including food, tuition contribution and scholastic materials, purchase of land and construction of buildings including a chapel, 
                        dormitory block, and multi-purpose hall.

                    <p>
                        We have since July 2024, successfully redesigned our program layout, strategized more efficient implementation models and launched new programs. 
                        With fishing banned on Lake Victoria, yet it was these communities’ primary source of income, there was dire need to transition our social change 
                        initiatives to better suit the vast community needs. In order to maximize impact per dollar spent, we have leaned more into Community-Based implementation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our closely interlinked multi-tier community transformation initiatives have now expanded to include a livelihoods component. The new programs/projects 
                        are enshrined in a Community-Driven Development (CDD) model, focusing on addressing the local needs of these communities through a more inclusive family 
                        empowerment approach. This focuses on boosting Household incomes, thus equipping families to have a better living standard through demand-driven, scalable, 
                        and low-cost local solutions that can translate into bigger impact per unit currency spent and are more sustainable.

                    <p>
                        This is intended: to meet the prevalent vast community needs more effectively and efficiently, create program sustainability and growth, broaden our resource 
                        base, expand our user-group outreach as well as empower the communities to own and resourcefully solve their problems. This way, we weaken the donor dependency 
                        syndrome and promote stewardship and resourcefulness, which is the most sustainable and cost-effective way to break the cycle of vulnerability among these communities.
